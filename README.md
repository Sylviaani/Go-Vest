This is an 'Impact Investment Marketplace' app which I will be building for my final project in alx 2023 C15. It will be on on-going project even after alx.

To build this project, I used:
(a) Node Js with Express Server
(b) MongoDB Cluster
(c) React
(d) Created a .env file to store all credentials.

Installation
I installed all dependencies using 'npm' and ran my React app(frontend) using 'npm start' and my Express server(backend) using 'node server.js'

Of course both ends are running on different ports so I enabled 'Cors' to handle the different domains and 'Axios' to handle API calls.
I also used 'POST' method to fetch my frontend data and send it to their various routes.
